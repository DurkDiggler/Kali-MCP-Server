# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the Kali MCP Server:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

**Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could expose the vulnerability to malicious actors before we have a chance to fix it.

### 2. Report privately

Please report security vulnerabilities privately by emailing us at:
- **Email**: security@your-org.com
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] Kali MCP Server Vulnerability Report

### 3. Include the following information

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: What the vulnerability allows an attacker to do
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Proof of concept**: If you have a proof of concept, please include it
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue, please share them

### 4. Response timeline

We will respond to security reports within **48 hours** and provide:
- Confirmation that we received your report
- An initial assessment of the vulnerability
- A timeline for fixing the issue

### 5. Disclosure timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Fix development**: Within 7 days (for critical vulnerabilities)
- **Public disclosure**: Within 30 days of the initial report

## Security Features

The Kali MCP Server includes several security features to protect against common attack vectors:

### Input Validation
- **Tool name validation**: Only whitelisted tools can be executed
- **Argument sanitization**: Command arguments are sanitized to prevent injection
- **Path sanitization**: File paths are sanitized to prevent directory traversal

### Sandboxing
- **Isolated execution**: Tools run in isolated environments
- **Environment restrictions**: Dangerous environment variables are removed
- **Working directory limits**: Execution is restricted to specific directories

### Resource Limits
- **Execution timeouts**: Tools are killed if they run too long
- **Output size limits**: Tool output is truncated to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Memory limits**: Docker containers have memory limits

### Audit Logging
- **Execution logging**: All tool executions are logged
- **Security event logging**: Security violations are logged
- **Access logging**: All API access is logged

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Network Security**
   - Deploy behind a firewall
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Restrict network access to trusted sources

2. **Access Control**
   - Use strong authentication mechanisms
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Regularly audit access logs
   - Rotate credentials regularly

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Set up alerting for security events
   - Regularly review logs
   - Monitor resource usage

4. **Updates**
   - Keep the server updated
   - Monitor for security advisories
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Test updates in a staging environment

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Avoid dangerous functions

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Monitor for known vulnerabilities
   - Use minimal dependencies

3. **Testing**
   - Write security tests
   - Perform regular security audits
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Test for common vulnerabilities

## Known Security Considerations

### Tool Execution
- **Powerful tools**: The server provides access to powerful security tools
- **Potential misuse**: Tools could be misused for malicious purposes
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper access controls and monitoring

### Command Injection
- **Risk**: Malicious input could lead to command injection
- **Mitigation**: Input validation and sanitization

### Path Traversal
- **Risk**: Malicious paths could access sensitive files
- **Mitigation**: Path sanitization and working directory restrictions

### Resource Exhaustion
- **Risk**: Malicious tools could exhaust system resources
- **Mitigation**: Timeouts and resource limits

## Security Updates

We regularly release security updates. To stay informed:

1. **Watch the repository**: Enable notifications for releases
2. **Subscribe to security advisories**: Monitor our security mailing list
3. **Check for updates**: Regularly check for new versions
4. **Apply patches promptly**: Install security updates as soon as possible

## Security Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: security@your-org.com
- **PGP Key**: [Available upon request]
- **Response time**: Within 48 hours

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Contributors will be acknowledged in our security advisories (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).

## Legal

By reporting a security vulnerability, you agree to:
- Not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to fix it
- Not use the vulnerability for malicious purposes
- Allow us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure

We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:
- Act in good faith
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Do not cause damage to our systems or users
